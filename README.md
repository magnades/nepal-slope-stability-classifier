# Nepal Slope Stability Classifier

This is a Streamlit web app that predicts the **slope stability** category for slopes in **Nepal**, based on a trained machine learning model using **evolutionary neural networks**.

## Features

- Predict slope stability based on geotechnical and environmental inputs.
- Model trained on Nepalese slope data.
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit.
